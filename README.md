# Book-Search-Engine

## Description

I decided to further my understanding of graphql, by refactoring the code for an already completed application into one that uses graphql. With this application a user can search for books using search functionality. They can then save books that they are interested in and then those books will be tied to their account. Completing this project helped me further my understanding of graphql and gave me more insight into the intricacies of creating a MERN application.

## Installation

1. On install please first npm run install
2. npm run build
3. npm run start

## Usage

On page start you can create an account and login yourself in. Once you have been logged in your can begin searching for novels using the search functionality, once the novels have been populated you can begin to save them to your account. With you can then retieve by clicking the 'See your books' link at the top of the page.
